ddr-local apps
==============


ddrlocal
--------

This app is a bit of a frankenstein:

Parts of it provide models and behavior for the second layer of the DDR stack: collection/object/file metadata.  Ideally these parts would be available in the context of the command-line app.

Other parts provide low-level forms and code that are inherited by the `webui` app that is responsible for the web UI that the user interacts with.

The `ddrlocal` app also represents the entire project to Django; after v1.5 this app is where Django looks for the `settings.py` file.

Clearly there is a need for some refactoring here.

storage
-------

This app is responsible for managing storage devices.  DDR is intended to be 


tematres

xmlforms
--------

This is a holdover from when the master data for each collection/entity/file was going to be kept in EAD or METS XML focuments.  `xmlforms` had a nifty ur-form that could generate Django form objects based on a data structure, and read/write data from XML documents using XPath.  All this was dropped in favor of storing object data in JSON, and `xmlforms` is no longer used.
