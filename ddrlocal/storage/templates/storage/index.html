  <dt>
    Is it plugged in?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Is the USB device physically plugged in to the machine you are using?<br/>
    Does the USB device appear in the <strong>Devices > USB Devices</strong> menu, and is it selected?
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Have you tried turning it off an on again?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Try unmounting the drive using the form above, and then remounting it.
    This is often the first thing that IT professionals try, and it often works!
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    You just said we need to remount the drive, and now this page says I have to unmount?
    I don't understand&mdash;which one is it???
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    When you shut down the virtual machine (VM), it sometimes cannot automatically reconnect to the USB drive.
    This program often has the information it needs to try a different method of remounting.
    But sometimes that doesn't work either.
    Just click "Unmount" and then "Mount" again.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Nothing's working! I can't get this program to see my USB drive!!! o_O
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Try rebooting the Virtual Machine (VM):
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Keep this browser window open.</li>
      <li>Find the "VirtualBox Manager" window (title may be slightly different).</li>
      <li>Locate the "ddrworkbench-*" Virtual Machine in the left-hand sidebar.</li>
      <li>Right-click on the VM, select "Close" and then "ACPI Shutdown" (or "Send the shutdown signal") from the pop-up menu.</li>
      <li>Wait for the VM to finish shutting down.  Take a deep breath.</li>
      <li>Right-click on the VM and select "Start".</li>
      <li>
        Wait a minute to give the VM time to boot and reconnect to the USB drive.
	Look at <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kittens&tbm=isch" target="kittens">some pictures</a> while you're waiting.
      </li>
      <li>Refresh the browser window.</li>
    </ol>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    I don't see my USB device in the <em>Devices > USB Devices</em> menu, and it's not in the "Hard Disk Drives" list in Windows Explorer either!  WTH???
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Take a deep breath.
    Sometimes VirtualBox and your host computer can't decide which one of them is connected to a USB device.
    This occasionally happens you shut down VM without unmounting its USB device first.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this case the only thing to do is to take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
    All kidding aside, if you can't find the drive anywhere (and you have confirmed that it is in fact plugged in to your computer), you'll just have to reboot your computer.
    Go get yourself a cup of coffee and look out the window for a bit.
    Things should be back to normal when it's finished rebooting.
    </p>

  <dt>
